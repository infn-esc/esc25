# An Introduction to Parallel Programming using OpenMP

This directory contains exercises and solutions for a hands-on
OpenMP course.  Information about these programs can be found
in the comments and in the slides from the course.

Most of these programs can be compiled (assuming Linux and a gcc compiler)

gcc -fopenmp program.c

The solutions directory contains a number of solutions to the parallel programming
problems we explore in this course.  It is important, however, that you
DO NOT look at those solutions until you have completed the exercises.

In the solutions director is a directory named Challenge_Problems.
It contains additional exercises for more advanced students.  These
have not been as carefully tested and may have problems building
and running on some systems.
