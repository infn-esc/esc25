# Basics 

## Your system
- you can inspect your system by using 
`lscpu`
`lstopo`

## C++ types

### Exercise 0: Sizeof 

Write a program to check the size of different data types:
You can use the `sizeof()` operator
- `char`, `bool`, `int`, `float`, `double`, `std::vector<double>`, `void*`
- Write your own struct/class with different memembers with different types and check the size your datastructure
- Try to swap the member order, does anything change?

### Exercise1:  Alignment

Write a program to check the alignment of different data types:
You can use the `sizeof()` operator
- `char`, `bool`, `int`, `float`, `double`, `std::vector<double>`, `void*`
- Write your own struct/class with different memembers with different types and check the size your datastructure
- Try to swap the member order, does anything change?


You can also use this code to easily inspect `sizeof()` and `alignof()`: [code](https://godbolt.org/z/KM78oxYcY)
