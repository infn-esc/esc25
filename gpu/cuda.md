# Introduction to GPU Programming 
### Hands-on

The CUDA Runtime API reference manual is a very useful source of information:
<a href="http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-runtime-api/index.html" target="_blank">http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-runtime-api/index.html</a>


Check that your environment is correctly configured to compile CUDA code by running:
```bash
$ nvcc --version
nvcc: NVIDIA (R) Cuda compiler driver
Copyright (c) 2005-2025 NVIDIA Corporation
Built on Wed_Aug_20_01:58:59_PM_PDT_2025
Cuda compilation tools, release 13.0, V13.0.88
Build cuda_13.0.r13.0/compiler.36424714_0
```


Compile and run the `deviceQuery` application:
```bash
$ cd hands-on/gpu/utils/deviceQuery
$ make
```

You can get some useful information about the features and the limits that you will find on the device you will be running your code on. For example:

```shell
$ ./deviceQuery
./deviceQuery Starting...

Some of you are sharing the same machine and some time measurements can be influenced by other users running at the very same moment. It can be necessary to run time measurements multiple times.


# GPU Training — Hands‑On Exercises

These short, self‑contained labs walk students from CUDA basics to a tiny predator–prey simulation.  Every exercise follows the same workflow:

```
1. Fill in all  ►►► TODO ◄◄◄  and/or kernel bodies.
2. Build with the line shown in the banner comment.
3. Run → the program prints “…PASSED 🎉” when assertions succeed.
```

All code lives under `/hands-on/gpu/cuda`.

## Exercise 1 – CUDA Memory Model

*Goal – feel the separation between CPU (host) and GPU (device) address spaces.*

| Step | What you implement                                   |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
|  1   | `cudaMallocAsync` two device buffers `d_a` and `d_b` |
|  2   | Copy host array `h_a → d_a`                          |
|  3   | Copy device array `d_a → d_b` (device‑to‑device)     |
|  4   | Copy back `d_b → h_a`                                |
|  5   | Free `d_a`, `d_b` with `cudaFreeAsync`               |

```bash
nvcc -std=c++20 memory_model.cu -o ex01
./ex01   # prints “Exercise 1 – memory model: PASSED 🎉”
```

### Variation

Add a non‑blocking version using **streams** + `cudaMemcpyAsync` and time a 100 MB H↔D copy to estimate PCIe bandwidth.

---

## Exercise 2 – Launch Your First Kernel

*Goal – understand grid/block configuration and indexing.*

1. `cudaMallocAsync` a device array `d_a[N]`
2. Launch a **1‑D grid** of **1‑D blocks**

   ```c++
   d_a[i] = i + 42;  // each thread writes one element
   ```
3. Copy back, verify, free the memory.

Compile & run:

```bash
nvcc -std=c++20 launch_kernel.cu -o ex02 && ./ex02
```

**Hint:** Global thread index = `blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x`.

---

## Exercise 3 – 2‑D Grid & Block

*Goal – move from 1‑D to 2‑D indexing.*

Matrix **M\[numRows × numCols]**.

| Task | Detail                                                                                          |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Set `numRows`, `numCols` (start with 4 × 4, then 19 × 67).                                      |
| 2    | Launch a **2‑D grid of 2‑D blocks** so each thread writes<br>`M[row,col] = row * numCols + col` |
| 3    | Copy to host, assert correctness                                                                |
| 4    | Experiment: fix block = `16×16`, compute `blocksPerGrid` with ceiling division                  |

Compile:

```bash
nvcc -std=c++20 ex03_fill_matrix.cu -o ex03 && ./ex03
```

---

## Exercise 4 – Parallel Reduction ∑

*Goal – sum a 1‑D array faster than the CPU.*

> **Rule of thumb:** keep each block power‑of‑two and reduce in shared memory.

1. Kernel #1: each block loads its slice, does **shared‑mem tree reduction**, writes one partial sum.
2. Kernel #2: single block reduces those partials into the final total.
3. Copy result, compare to `std::accumulate`.

*Bonus*: one‑step reduction (single kernel).

---

## Parallel Challenge – **The Circle of Life**

A toroidal predator–prey world.  Build the starter **CPU version** first, then port to CUDA

Reference CPU build:

```bash
make serial
./circle_of_life --width 256 --height 256 --seed 42
```

Can you use the asynchronous GPU kernel launch to execute the generation of a git frame on the CPU while the GPU is running the next iteration?

### Common Pitfalls & Tips

* **Always** `cudaGetLastError()` after a launch when debugging.
* Use **asserts** on the host to check results before optimising.
* Remember `cudaStreamSynchronize()` before timing or freeing async memory.
* `dim3` defaults `z=1`; you almost never need a non‑unit Z for these labs.
* For reductions, `blockDim.x` **must** be a power‑of‑two when you half the stride each step.
